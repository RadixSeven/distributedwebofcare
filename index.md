Distributed Web of Care is an initiative to *code to care* and *code carefully*. 

The project commenced in 2018 and continues to develop today, seeking to imagine the future of the internet and consider what care means for a technologically-oriented future. The project focuses on personhood in relation to accessibility, identity, and the environment, with the intention of designing a distributed future thatâ€™s built with trust and care, where diverse communities are prioritized and supported.

The project is composed of community collaborations, educational resources, skillshares, an editorial platform, and performance-lectures. Announcements and documentation are hosted on this site, as well as new essays and pieces of writing published by select artists, technologists, and activists. 

Distributed on [Dat](dat://distributedweb.care/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/tchoi8/distributedwebofcare).
