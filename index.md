Distributed Web of Care is an initiative to *code to care* and *code carefully*. 

The project imagines the future of the internet and consider what care means for a technologically-oriented future.

The project is composed of collaborations, educational resources, skillshares, an editorial platform, and performance. Announcements and documentation are hosted on this site, as well as essays by select artists, technologists, and activists.
