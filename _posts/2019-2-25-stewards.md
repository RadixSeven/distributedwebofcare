Distributed Web of Care (DWC) is a collaboration between artists, writers and engineers to imagine a more equitable, caring internet for the future. The project is initiated by Taeyoon Choi, who has been working with disability community and artists to criticially challenge the notions of accessibility and inclusion. Read his article [Artificial Advancement](https://thenewinquiry.com/artificial-advancements/) and Shannon Finnegan's article [Accessibility Dreams](http://distributedweb.care/posts/accessibility-dreams/).

In February - March 2019, we are looking for stewards who identify as a Deaf or disabled person. We are planning a large scale participatory performance art in the end of March. The event will have ASL interpretation and audio description. We would like to work with stewards who identify as a Deaf or Disabled person to create an inclusive and welcoming experience for the disability community.   

Stewards are guest collaborators, contributing to DWC initiatives with their domain expertise. Stewards are invited to rehearsals for DWC events and contribute to building the piece as well as code of conduct. In this volunteer role, stewards will collaborate with fellow artists, engineers, organizers, staff and with Taeyoon Choi directly.  

The rehearsal dates are March 2, 2-5 PM and March 25, 2-5 PM, 2019 in Manhattan, NYC.
