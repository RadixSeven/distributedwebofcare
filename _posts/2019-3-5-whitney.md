Distributed Web of Care at the Whitney Museum of American Art 

WED, Mar 27, 2019
7 pm

[Ticket](https://whitney.org/events/distributed-web-of-care
)

Susan and John Hess Family Gallery and Theater

This lecture-performance by Taeyoon Choi imagines a more equitable, caring Internet and asks: what kind of network do we want for the future? Choi engages in a conversation with Chancey Fleet, Jonathan Dahan, and stewards and students from the School for Poetic Computation to explore the poetics and politics of computation, the relationship between Internet privacy and collective agency, and alternative methods of communicating via peer-to-peer protocols. The discussion considers the Internet’s underlying structure and how bodily experiences of the Internet differ for disability communities and other marginalized groups. The conversation is followed by an interactive performance choreographed by Choi and Jerron Herman, accompanied by live audio from Tiri Kananuruk and stud1nt. The movements explore how it feels to be a node programmed in centralized, decentralized, and distributed networks.

ASL interpretation and audio description are available.
