### 5. QTPOC perspectives

- Preservation of privacy and intimacy VS Openness and inclusivity 
- Abuse, misuse, harassment scenarios 
- Decolonizing the internet 
- Honoring the indigeneous and traditional communities, land and the environment 
- Deaf and Disabled rights on the Decentralized web 

<br>

### 6. Critical perspectives 
- Corporate appropriations and re-centralization 
- "Decentralization is not the goal. Orthogonality of Data, Transport, Identity 'not used to capture each other, they are 90 degrees from each other' for Information freedom and user agency. For a sense of self and privacy" - Peter Wang's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1314&v=-z47R9wN5SQ) at the DWEB Camp 
- Military contracts: Brooklyn Start Up [GoTenna](https://gotennamesh.com/products/mesh) lands a [contract](https://www.usaspending.gov/#/keyword_search/gotenna) with the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection
- Controversies regarding copyright, ownership and code of conduct 

### 7 . Leaving with a positive note

### 8. A case for emergent networks
- "trust the people and they become trustworthy. trust the people and you will become trustworthy." [
trust the people](http://adriennemareebrown.net/2019/07/01/trust-the-people-2/) by adrienne maree brown
- "We are not idealistic. Decentralization is not a solution to the problems of the centralized networks. However, we are not pessimistic. Decentralized networks, when they are designed by the folx traditionally marginalized from the networks, LGBTQPOC, Deaf, Disabled, Indigenous and traditional communities,  can lead to an equitable, distribtued web of care." by Taeyoon Choi
