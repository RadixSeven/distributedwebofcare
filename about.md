The Distributed Web of Care (DWC) project is an initiative of [Taeyoon Workshop](http://taeyoonchoi.com/) based in New York City in collaboration with DWC stewards, fellows, and participants, weaving together different ideas and expertise. Taeyoon Choi is an artist and cofounder of the [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/) and was a fellow from 2017-2018 at [Data & Society](https://datasociety.net/people/choi-taeyoon/). 

Much of his work engages with concepts of personhood and technology, particularly as it intersects with the experiences of minority and disability communities. His article, [*Artificial Advancements*,](https://thenewinquiry.com/artificial-advancements/) published in The New Inquiry, challenges the notion that technological innovation is an inherent good for disabled people, offering instead the concept of [Soft Care](http://taeyoonchoi.com/soft-care/). He writes, “Care, in contrast to cure, is a form of stewardship between people who support each other in communication, action, and social engagement. It is actualized by extending one’s mindfulness of another person’s dignity and feelings, while respecting their independence.”.

## Project History

In May of 2018, two DWC fellows, **Cleo Miao** (Design and Storytelling Fellow) and **Callil Capuozzo** (Technology and Documentation Fellow) were [selected](http://distributedweb.care/posts/summer-2018-fellows/) through an open call. They were instrumental in coordinating [Skillshares: Peers in Practice](http://distributedweb.care/posts/skillshares/) and the [DWC Party](http://distributedweb.care/posts/party/). You can read about their work and reflections from the summer [here](http://distributedweb.care/posts/callil/), [here](http://distributedweb.care/posts/cleo/), and [here](http://distributedweb.care/posts/creative-publishing/). 


In July of 2018 the DWC curated a group of artists for the [Ace Hotel Artists in Residence program](http://distributedweb.care/posts/air/), including **Ari Melenciano**, **Jessica Lynne**, **Mindy Seu**, **Stephanie Gray**, and **Shannon Finnegan**. Relevant documentation and reflections from their experience are published on the site. 

Lead by choreographer **Cori Kresge**, several more DWC stewards joined the project, helping to imagine choreography and movement exercises to explore how it feels to be a node programmed in different network structures. The exercises were activated at Rhizome’s [Ethics & Archiving the Web](http://dwc-tchoi8.hashbase.io/) conference at the New Museum in New York, at the [Decentralized Web Summit](https://www.decentralizedweb.net/distributed-web-of-care/) in San Francisco, and at Knockdown Center in Queens, NY as part of [Refiguring the Future](https://www.decentralizedweb.net/distributed-web-of-care/) conference.

In March of 2019 the DWC performed a Lecture Performance at the [Whitney Museum](http://distributedweb.care/posts/whitney/), with new collaborations from dancer **Jerron Harman**, sound artists **stud1nt** and **Tiriree Kananuruk**, programmer **Jonathan Dahan**, and educator and disability activist **Chancey Fleet**. The performance, guided by the help of thirteen stewards, focused specifically on the element of access and ability. Full credits for the event can be found [here](http://distributedweb.care/posts/whitney/).

The project will continue to develop through various partnerships in 2019 - 2020. In summer 2019 we are focusing on skillshare events and *With You For You: School Board of the Wise*, a collaboration with [BUFU](http://www.bufubyusforus.com/past-events). Currently there are no open calls for fellowships available at this time.

**Shira Feldman** acts as Editor for the DWC publishing platform. We will continue to invite artists and technologists to contribute essays and articles which explore themes of distribution, accessibility, community, and the politics and poetics of computation.
