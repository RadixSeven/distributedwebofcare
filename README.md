This class is a part of DWC. Can we code to care and code carefully? The Distributed Web of Care (DWC) is a research initiative on communication protocol, network infrastructure, exploring the Distributed Web as a peer-to-peer, alternative web which prioritizes personhood, collective agency and individual ownership of data and code.
