&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attending. Attending. Attending. As you prepare to demonstrate your prowess, attend to the ones here. If ego plays a part, you are doomed. Also, you’ve got something to offer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/jerron/1_jerron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image description: Jerron Herman takes the floor to guide participants through movement exercises, exploring the various states a network can be. He stands in all black in the center of the room, with one arm raised and the other cradling his torso. The stewards in DWC shirts sit on the ground around him, in front of the audience seating. He introduces himself as “a disabled dancer with an interest in bridging disparate things together, hence computational theory and dance.” Jerron tells the audience that together we’ll be going through “experiences of taking the networks - centralized, decentralized, and distributed into our bodies.” He states his intent of using the disability experience to deepen our communal understanding of care, offering the idea of “disability genius,” as a singularly distinct output a disabled folk will communicate in a new way of working.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you have to encourage yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributing to the Distributed Web of Care event at The Whitney Museum was a real-time activation of collaboration for me, one that still reverberates across my professional career in impressionable ways. In it I learned the compelling truth of humility and the liberation of stewardship. When developing a solo practice, it is very common to take on everything and any delegation is done begrudgingly, when time or energy is scarce. One never seeks help with full capacity. Yet, as I entered the first rehearsal of DWC, I felt the unmistakable dizziness of assistance, of support. In addition to the DWC Stewards, a steering collective of artists and engineers, the space contained a scribe, multiple rooms to play, smart volunteers, and snacks. These are considered luxuries in other contexts whereas here it was commonplace. This context set me up to imbibe on critical thought that was not based on exasperation or exhaustion; this was an easy task, the rigorous part was yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still processing the series of events: invitation to interpret distributed networks via movement, good first rehearsal, dismal tech rehearsal, formative discussion, last minute rehearsal, magical activation. Across these events I felt my usual tension to perform melt to the simmering sensation of release, an incomprehensible comfort with unknowing and a growing delight in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How was I to know Distributed Web of Care was a metaphor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humility is possibly the last emotion before a breakthrough. With humility, one is absolved of their need to strive, instead becoming present, able to mindfully solve problems without needing perfection. I believed, as a first-time collaborator to the project, that I didn’t know how to interpret this vast ontological concept, this new ideology, that was &lt;em&gt;distributed web of care.&lt;/em&gt; I began to regurgitate Taeyoon and Cori Kresge’s original formula, thinking no one would see me slipping if I just repurposed a found object. Yet, it was evident that in denying the activation of my voice, even the template fell flat for this event. It could not be regurgitated. But I had other rehearsals and jobs where I was responsible for grants and donors, not to mention my own self-care. It could not be regurgitated. Confronted with this truth, I finally asked for clarity, a brainstorm, another way in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was after our tech rehearsal at the Whitney. You know that feeling that something’s not right, but we’re all smiling through? I was so bemused by the DWC collaborators’ generosity and optimism that I didn’t want to seem confused or possibly laborious because I needed some extra help. We’re all doing our part. But I remember approaching Taeyoon, understanding Taeyoon, to reveal that I was lacking some grounded identity. Reassuring, he suggested a phone call the next day wherein we collaborated on the format. Clarity happened with the introduction of myself in the web of care. I thought, what am I curious about? The answer(s) were how this activity would expand relationships and get us moving, period. With a new breath, and my intention on the event restored, I made a movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with the movement phrase. It was deliciously simple and yet very “of my body” which made me feel more comfortable about facilitation. I tried out the phrase - mostly torso and hands to mitigate any separation for those seated or otherwise less mobile - in the communal holding space at The Whitney in plainview of the stewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can play the facilitator or actually facilitate. I have internalized this unnecessary pressure as the facilitator to be flawless in the presence of audience or aids, but do not have a critical framework for failure. So, I’m simply nervous to fail and that’s all. In this experiment I spent too much time worrying rather than enjoying. The stewards were never supposed to be my lemmings, but my peers; us working together. I finally saw that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to facilitate when I simplified what would occur and what would be the parts of entry for the stewards. From another, still complicated but clearer, rehearsal I set a plan and continually asked for agreement from the group. We would explicitly use the three totems of the web of care, “centralized”, “decentralized”, “distributed” and refer to our individual and collective bodies as the metaphor. So people would first feel their own network, then relate to multiple networks through extended tethering activities, like creating smaller circles of networks. The stewards were going to hold the space for others to explore and be centering figures, mediating my instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/jerron/2_jerron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image description: Jerron guides the audience through the first movement exercise: recognizing and feeling our own individual sense of network before we start to experience others’. Participants and stewards have their arm raised in various directions, instructed by Jerron to “take your right arm and extend it out in a safe position, maybe in front, maybe behind, maybe above you.” He continues to guide, “move it [your arm] around a little bit in a circular motion, but keeping the tension of the arm as straight or as tense as it can be.” After being led through other exercises of feeling our own bodies, Jerron states: “that’s your network. Your own individual network”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an extraordinary mutual learning moment in the midst of us creating smaller networks where one steward, Lori Hepner, disclosed she felt particularly stressed about the activity involving coordinated movement within the “decentralized” section. In this section, stewards and participants would take my guided choreography into smaller networks to replicate and interpret without my facilitation. In these smaller networks, they would have to know and continue the movement in a more private way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew this moment. Even as a professional dancer I still cannot “pick up” choreography. I need time to orient myself if facings to the front change or I need time to feel it when different parts of the body are being employed. This activity was supposed to be accessible. However, accessible doesn’t just mean easier, it means equitable. How can one enter into a space on their own terms. It’s more about possessing the amount of information that breeds the most autonomy - knowing where the bathroom is located, how many steps to the bar, who surrounds me, and what movement quality are you really looking for - this knowledge combines with a personalized fortitude to make something inviting. As Lori and I talked, I reassured her that her autonomy was intact in the exercise. Still unsure, she would become an asset in another way. She would use her voice to describe and translate my movement during the event for everyone, making the choreography accessible and helping me transform access into an aesthetic. &lt;strong&gt;There’s tension in access because it can shift. When we approach access like art, it retains a form of care.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/jerron/3_jerron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image description: Participants take the floor, standing behind Jerron who’s center in front of the audience. Lori Hepner stands to the right of Jerron at the front, holding a microphone to announce the choreography to the room. Jerron’s right arm is extended out towards his right side, bent ever so slightly into a downward facing arc. The crowd follows his movements behind him, with a slew of arms extending outwards in the distance. As Jeron begins to lead the room through movements he announces, “In the centralized place, you don’t have autonomy. So what I’m going to do is take you through a piece of choreography that you’re going to have to take on and then we’ll figure out what happens next.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/jerron/4_jerron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the crowd now dispersed into smaller circles, a DWC steward is captured interpreting Jerron’s choreography as her own now. She reaches her right arm outwards towards her right side, her torso and head follow accordingly. Behind her is a group of participants, each themselves interpreting the choreography without instruction. These are the smaller, decentralized networks, where the task remains to just interpret. Jerron guides them, stating: “when I say ‘go.’ you’re going to take on the same movement you just learned, and your intention is to imagine an invisible string that connects you all, and yet its not there. So from here, recreate the movement and see what happens.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/jerron/5_jerron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image description: An older woman with orange tinted glasses, a blue sweater, and white hair stands in front of a group of other participants, holding a pink string with both hands in front of her. The string is part of a larger web, criss-crossing and tangling behind her. Introducing the element of string and the final phase of distribution, Jerron tells the audience, “In this configuration now, you’re going to speak to each other…with the choice of three phrases: ‘May I?’ ‘Can I’ and ‘I will.” In the distributed configuration, the intention is “to remain connected as you complete the choreography…but then also try and create connections that otherwise weren’t there the first time you tried this choreography.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/jerron/6_jerron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image description: A diverse group of people look tenderly towards one another entangled in a web pink string. Some arms are raised upwards holding the string, some stay holding it closer to the body. Jerron affirms the group that at this point, “some of the choreography has gone out the window.” He also instructs them participants that “should they want to leave the network, you can.” In the distributed phase, audience members have autonomy over both their movements, and their participation in the choreography itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhilarating climax to this experience with the Distributed Web of Care occured when the majority of attendees stood to create the first large circle. In that moment I realized language, intention, inflection, body language, and space had communicated to them permission to be present and experience together. What did we do to get here? From my standpoint the prompts I gave came out of ways I usually felt connected. Simple and deep prompts, like place your head on your neighbor’s shoulder. Still, I was taken aback by their willingness to be vulnerable. In my mind I went back to the rehearsal even a few hours before when the stewards and I didn’t know how the large audience participation would  settle in our bodies. We had gone through “feeling your own network” and had a semblance of what the smaller networks would entail. The larger circle was a great unknown. The scale was different: by rehearsal we had grown familiar with each other to warrant comfort to lean on someone’s shoulder, not so in the activation. I lovingly mentioned this with, “we didn’t have this in rehearsal!” There was a shorter, older woman next to me who delighted in being asked to lean or squeeze or participate. Her reaction was mine. The proceeding elements of play disbursed with glee as stewards wielded string and participants entangled themselves, as people closely observed disabled movement alongside a live audio description, and enjoyed a bespoke accompaniment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/jerron/7_jerron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image description: Approximately 25 audience members participate in the scaffolding activity. They stand shoulder to shoulder next to one another, learning collectively towards the right side. Their heads and weight rest on the shoulder of the person to the right of them. Bound tightly together, the tilted configuration retains a steadiness and stability, marked by shared participation, trust, and care.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a group of people forever bound by a night at the Whitney. Within, the presentations and knowledge crept into their bodies, then their bodies creatively expressed minute or massive understanding of the new bits of knowledge, eventually creating an atmosphere that I thought symbolic of the content. Care is an action and we collectively built ourselves up through mutual understanding and joy to act carefully. I know everyone who attended the Distributed Web of Care event carries it with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered this activation striving to be worthy of a computational theorist only to realize that as much unlearning needs to occur as learning. I think when stewardship is invoked, an almost archaic word already, bringing notes of feudalism and lords, it calls on you to be similarly valorous. How? By true presence and presence alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/jerron/8_jerron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image description: A DWC Steward smiles jubilantly, with her eyes closed and arms raised above her as she holds onto the pink string, entangling behind her into the web of people. The image captures a moment of presence, focus, delight and trust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jerron Herman is an interdisciplinary artist who’s been featured with Heidi Latsky Dance at Lincoln Center, ADF, the Whitney Museum, and abroad in Athens. He’s been a principal member of HLD since 2011. Jerron now serves on the Board of Trustees at Dance/USA. Jerron has also shot for Tommy Hilfiger Adaptive, consulted for a Nike-sponsored project, and was profiled in Great Big Story. In 2018 he was a Snug Harbor PASS artist, a finalist for the inaugural Apothetae/Lark Play Development Lab Fellowship and was nominated for a Fellowship in Dance from United States Artists. His latest solos include Phys. Ed. and Relative – a crip dance party. Jerron studied at Tisch School of the Arts and graduated from The King’s College. The New York Times has called him, “…the inexhaustible Mr. Herman.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://jerronherman.com/&quot;&gt;www.jerronherman.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">by Jerron Herman</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Who Owns the Stars: The Trouble with Urbit</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/who-owns-the-stars/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Who Owns the Stars: The Trouble with Urbit" /><published>2019-05-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/who-owns-the-stars</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/who-owns-the-stars/">&lt;p&gt;by Francis Tseng&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application that introduced peer-to-peer (P2P) computing to the mainstream was file sharing, services like Napster, Kazaa, Gnutella, and BitTorrent. For me, these programs were the first time the contradiction of artificial scarcity—the imposed scarcity of infinitely replicable digital information—and the excessive measures that were used to enforce it became startlingly clear. Over time, I encountered the term P2P in other settings and alongside other ideas—democratic governance, communalism, autonomy, cooperatives—and I started to see the purchase this idea had beyond file sharing and networking protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://p2pfoundation.net/the-p2p-foundation/about-the-p2p-foundation&quot;&gt;The P2P Foundation’s mission and strategic priorities&lt;/a&gt;, for example, extend the early P2P ideas of open culture and exchange into values of cooperative living and regenerative production. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/principles/&quot;&gt;Scuttlebutt, a more recent P2P social networking protocol, has its own “principles stack”&lt;/a&gt; that similarly advocates pluralistic exchange and mutual interdependence. It’s beautiful how, at least in the ideal scenario, by using a P2P service we are helping others access it as well. P2P is both an acknowledgment of our shared needs and an example of how cooperation helps us fulfill those needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve followed along with P2P projects because of these shared values, and I always find it exciting when new projects emerge. It seems that P2P is experiencing something of a renaissance, likely due to the frenzy around blockchain (which purports to offer something similar to P2P) and the increasing popular anxiety around centralized internet services like Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/&quot;&gt;a personal server built from scratch&lt;/a&gt;,” first came across my radar a couple of years ago. Urbit positions itself as a P2P project, but it stands out in contrast to other P2P projects, mainly because the person behind it, Curtis Yarvin, seems antithetical to what I understand P2P to represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My central question is this: &lt;em&gt;Is Urbit a project that should be supported?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can further break this down into two parts. First, Urbit’s marketing materials correctly identify that concentrated data aggregation and decision-making power are fundamental issues of the internet-as-we-know-it. Twitter’s persistent neglect of harassment on its platform is one everyday example. It is clear that new protocols and platforms that reduce our dependency on distant power are needed to challenge these issues. What’s less clear, though, is whether or not Urbit actually offers a meaningful alternative. Does Urbit genuinely enable new kinds of relations? Or, does it merely replace the old aristocracy with a new one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, and more urgent, question is: who and what are we supporting by supporting Urbit? Many people in tech still believe that technology can be divorced from its creators; however, those of us in tech need to recognize that we have a considerable amount of influence over which products enter the mainstream consciousness, which products get created at all, and who receives both financial and social capital (shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techworkerscoalition.org/&quot;&gt;Tech Workers Coalition&lt;/a&gt; et al.). For example, consider Peter Thiel , who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook. Early support of PayPal and Facebook contributed to their financial success, which developed Thiel’s influence and made him quite rich. Thiel then turned that money and influence into Palantir Technologies, a software company that &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/&quot;&gt;develops technologies to help expand surveillance and deportation for the government&lt;/a&gt;. We have to consider what similar groundwork we help to lay by supporting Urbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to discuss Urbit’s design, we need to have an understanding of the politics of its creator, Curtis Yarvin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin&quot;&gt;Curtis Yarvin&lt;/a&gt; is innocuously described on Wikipedia as an “American political theorist and computer scientist,” but to many, he is better known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/&quot;&gt;one of the intellectual forebears of the alt-right&lt;/a&gt;. From 2007 to 2014&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, working under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin writings, which among other things espoused anti-democratic ideas and scientific racism and helped introduce many of what are now understood as the alt-right’s foundational ideologies to a wider public. The term “red pill,” which describes the process of reactionary radicalization and the community around it, was first used in this way by Yarvin.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Defenders of Urbit are quick to dismiss any inclusion of Yarvin’s politics in discussions about Urbit as unfair or irrelevant, and might point out that Yarvin left the project in January of this year.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, given that Yarvin basically laid out the general design for Urbit independently, as he worked on it alone for 11 years&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and in parallel with his political writings&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and that Urbit, as a P2P project, is a fundamentally social and thus incorporates ideas about how people should be organized, Yarvin’s politics should be considered as something that influences his design decisions and his long-term vision for the project. &lt;a href=&quot;https://lobste.rs/s/z5j1hq/urbit_2017#c_4z4gik&quot;&gt;Dog-whistles&lt;/a&gt; have been identified in some of his writing about Urbit and its design, including his &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/&quot;&gt;leaning on Nazi philosopher Carl Schmitt&lt;/a&gt; for questions around Urbit’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save space I’ll provide only a very brief overview of Yarvin’s political philosophy—if you like, you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebaffler.com/latest/mouthbreathing-machiavellis&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/03/28/the-darkness-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-artificial-intelligence-and-neoreaction/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yavin refers to his brand of political philosophy as “neocameralism.” Neocameralism, as described in his essay “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/08/against-political-freedom/&quot;&gt;Against Political Freedom&lt;/a&gt;,” is a political philosophy arguing that state should be run like a business, (i.e., with a CEO at its head and no democratic mechanisms). His ideas are credited as being foundational to the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/&quot;&gt;neoreactionary” movement&lt;/a&gt;, which could be described as a neo-monarchist movement (though Yarvin himself doesn’t identify as a “monarchist” because of its association with a constitutional monarchy and not absolute monarchy). In the neoreactionary movement, “divine right” is supplanted with “genetic right” based on scientific racism reframed as “human biodiversity.” Yarvin’s writings are also popular within the right-libertarian sects of Silicon Valley, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein&quot;&gt;with Peter Thiel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14671978/alt-right-mencius-moldbug-urbit-curtis-yarvin-tlon&quot;&gt;Peter Thiel also has a stake in Tlön&lt;/a&gt;, Yarvin’s company which develops Urbit, via Thiel’s VC firm, Founders Fund). The point here is that Yarvin is not a fringe philosopher. His writings have influence over people with considerable power and contributes to the intellectual miasma that emboldens and normalizes anti-democratic, anti-immigrant, misogynistic, and racist policies and attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;urbit&quot;&gt;Urbit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-self-sovereign-internet&quot;&gt;A self-sovereign internet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit positions itself as infrastructure for self-sovereignty in the digital age, liberating people from ceding control of their data to corporations.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The core idea is that Urbit helps you run a personal server that acts as an intermediary between you and other services, including existing services like Facebook (yes, there is a lot more to Urbit—such as its reinvention of parts of the lower-level computational stack—but its P2P layer is what’s of interest here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-sovereignty is an important principle, and I wager that many who regularly use the internet would agree that more of it is valuable for a healthy internet: for being able to control who can access your data, who can and cannot contact you, and so on. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt;, self-sovereignty is far too vague of a concept on its own. Left- and right-libertarianism both start with self-sovereignty as a core value, but they end up with vastly different conceptions of what meaningful self-sovereignty looks like and how it can be achieved. Left-libertarianism finds that self-sovereignty arises from social organizing, care, and democratic governance, which build towards positive freedoms (freedom to learn, to flourish, and so on); whereas, right-libertarianism believes it comes from the market and that negative freedoms (freedom from restrictions and regulation) are the goal. Though Yarvin does not identify as a libertarian (he is, in his own words, sympathetic to it), his neocameralism is right-libertarianism taken to its logical conclusion&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of corporate tyranny and serfdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To draw an example that you might be familiar with, consider the Twitter-alternative, Gab, which markets itself as a bastion for free speech. Gab, in practice, operates as a niche platform for members of the far-right who have been banned from Twitter: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html&quot;&gt;a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists&lt;/a&gt;”. We might ask then, is Gab a platform for free speech, or is it a platform for hate speech? Who’s speech does Gab prioritize? It quickly becomes clear that the concept of “free speech” that Gab deploys is not quite the same as what others see it to mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, this slipperiness of self-sovereignty as a concept, especially in light of Yarvin’s political writings, makes me suspicious of what it really means in the context of Urbit. Is Urbit actually designed to give users more autonomy and control? Does it restore any power to internet users?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One central design feature of Urbit is its network hierarchy. As a participant in Urbit, you may be a galaxy (the top of the hierarchy), a star (which fall under galaxies), or a planet (which fall under stars). The description of this hierarchy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cgyarvin/urbit/blob/6ac688960687aa9c89d4da6fff49a3125c10aca1/Spec/urbit/3-intro.txt&quot;&gt;used to use explicitly feudal metaphors&lt;/a&gt; as part of what Yarvin called “digital feudalism,” with himself as the “prince,” and further contributes to my suspicion of Yarvin’s conception of self-sovereignty actually entails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In trying to backpedal on these naming conventions, Yarvin claims that his ideas about governance are flipped for the internet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the real world today is governed as an insanely dysfunctional republic, and the Internet today is governed as a cluster of insanely despotic corporate monarchies, it doesn’t strike me as at all inconsistent with historical thought to treat the former case of misgovernment with efficient monarchism, and the latter case with liberating republicanism.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rationale for why the opposite is the ideal in each case—beyond contrarianism, at least—is unclear. We should dig into how Urbit’s governance is laid out to better understand what’s going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit’s primary governance model is a “self-governing digital republic” where &lt;em&gt;“authority is proportional to property.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Galaxies, stars, and planets are conceived of as property to be purchased and in limited supply, and one’s power within Urbit is determined by what tier of ownership they occupy and how much they own. The republic is structured as a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/the-urbit-address-space/&quot;&gt;three-chambered legislature balanced against itself&lt;/a&gt;,” where galaxies, stars, and planets constitute the three tiers. There is not much detail on how this government would operate, other than an &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/interim-constitution/&quot;&gt;interim constitution&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t describe how these tiers actually balance each other. For instance, the “planetary assembly”, which manages technical governance, doesn’t have any oversight of the “stellar congress”, which manages internal governance, or the “galactic senate”, which selects consuls, who hold “full authority” in this interim.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When it comes to the stars and galaxies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/why-urbit-probably-does-not-need-a-blockchain/&quot;&gt;the extent of your political agency as a planet is exit&lt;/a&gt;—that is, the only meaningful action you can take is to move to a different host star.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This notion of “exit,” which is popular among Silicon Valley libertarians like Peter Thiel&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, is a key part of Yarvin’s political philosophy. It is summarized as, in Yarvin’s own words as: “If residents don’t like their government, they can and should move.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Of course, this formulation of mobility as the ultimate form of political action neglects all the actual complications of uprooting yourself (leaving behind friends, family, and history), the question of whether or not any other place will accept you (e.g., in the case of borders or discrimination), and reduces your political expression to a single vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, exit in a digital context is logistically simpler than in a physical one, but it is still not easy. People critical of Twitter’s policies still use Twitter, not because they are hypocritical but because it’s a lot of effort to migrate to a new platform and re-establish connections from the former. People critical of Facebook may remain because it’s the only connection they have to some friends and family members. In both of these cases, having some mechanisms for democratic oversight would be more effective than showing people the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still further issues with exiting. For example, I may be unable to exit if, perhaps for discriminatory reasons, I cannot find a star that is willing to host me. Or, I may be unable to establish my own star if no one is willing to sell to me for similar reasons. Additionally, we are forced to ask, How bad do things have to get before I decide to exit? Do I just have to endure everything below that threshold? The point of other (democratic) forms of political voice and agency are that they allow us to have a nuanced process of change, one that allows for fundamental shifts as well as the fine-tuning that is inevitably necessary. Limiting one’s political agency to exit, dismisses any potential for incremental change or open discussion—basically, if you don’t like the way things are, you can go. Otherwise, shut up and take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;property-ownership-and-power&quot;&gt;Property, ownership, and power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;“authority is proportional to property”&lt;/em&gt; in Urbit, we should look more closely at how ownership is understood and operates in its design.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/a-founders-farewell/&quot;&gt;his farewell&lt;/a&gt;, Yarvin, out of ignorance or for rhetorical purposes, does not seem to recognize how ownership is a power relation. This is especially baffling because, as just quoted, in Urbit power and ownership are explicitly linked. Somehow in Yarvin’s broader understanding of things, property ownership is “random” and this means we should just let it be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you live in Manhattan, you simply don’t worry about who owns it or why; and nor does it matter. Are they Jews? Muslims? Christians? Communists? Italians? You don’t care and you don’t have to. You know it’s basically random and probably unfair. Randomness, even blatant unfairness, creates a kind of neutral, peaceful, even promising urban anonymity.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, contrary to Yarvin’s claims, who owns what in Manhattan matters to a great many people. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/upshot/when-the-empty-apartment-next-door-is-owned-by-an-oligarch.html&quot;&gt;apartments left vacant&lt;/a&gt; to be used as investment vehicles, or else in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brickunderground.com/rent/pied-a-terre-airbnb-affordable-housing-crisis-nyc&quot;&gt;low-use&lt;/a&gt; because it’s more profitable to rent them out as Airbnbs, many people are rightfully critical of who owns (and profits) from these properties—properties that could, among other things, serve to house some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bowery.org/homelessness/&quot;&gt;New York’s homeless population&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, people are critical of how the developers who own large portions of the city &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/developers-of-manhattan-luxury-towers-give-millions-to-upstate-candidates&quot;&gt;use their positions to lobby state government&lt;/a&gt; to compound and expand their influence. Whether or not the current allocation of Manhattan’s space is random (how developers lobby local government is a clear example that it’s not) or unfair does not mean we should throw up our hands and let it be. This line of argumentation is a red herring to deter questioning the property-power dynamics that undergird Urbit’s design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If power in Urbit is predicated on ownership, then it’s worth asking who owns what. The distribution of galaxies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/the-urbit-address-space/&quot;&gt;as of 2016 at least&lt;/a&gt;) puts 185 of the 256 in the hands of Tlön, Tlön’s employees, and urbit.org (which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/interim-constitution/&quot;&gt;currently under management and ownership of Tlön&lt;/a&gt;). The story for stars is not much different: 57.62% of stars (almost 38,000 of the 65,500 stars) are also owned by Tlön, its employees, and urbit.org. Even with Urbit’s tiered hierarchical structure, which ostensibly decentralizes power, we can see that power is quite concentrated (which they acknowledge).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comparison to Manhattan calls back to Urbit developers’ comparison of their system to land.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Urbit’s design creates a class of digital landlords who are the primary political authorities. There are obviously significant differences between physical land and digital space, but it strikes me as a regression to reproduce land scarcity (and rent-seeking structures) in cyberspace. For Urbit’s digital land, scarcity has to be manufactured, and manufactured digital scarcity seems antithetical to P2P values—where the easy replicability of data represents new opportunities and alternatives to the crude economies we’ve stumbled through in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How then does Urbit justify this manufactured scarcity? The primary reason is as a defense against Sybil attacks—a class of attacks endemic to pretty much any digital networking system where adversaries can generate identities in bulk to attack the system (e.g., DDoS attacks or spam).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Spam is something like a Sybil attack—it’s easy to make tons of email addresses and use them to bombard people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper that introduced Sybil attacks proved that there is no way to altogether prevent such attacks without introducing a centralized identity-verification authority.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the case of spam this would be like one organization that manages a global registry of non-spam emails. There are, however, ways to make Sybil attacks more expensive and thus less feasible to execute. In the case of Urbit, the scarcity is meant to compel prices for stars and planets such that they are too expensive for an attacker to purchase in bulk.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other decentralized Sybil-defense schemes proposed for P2P networking. Some introduce cryptographic puzzles, similar to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Others are based on explicit trust in social networks.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:20&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These approaches aren’t without their flaws—Sybil attacks can’t be completely prevented, after all—but, crucially, these schemes don’t introduce points of centralization that require concentrated trust or introduce authorities that can exclude non-adversarial actors from the network. Because Urbit’s supply is explicitly controlled by owners of galaxies and stars, they can deny people access for any arbitrary reason. This is especially concerning because of the aforementioned concentration of Urbit property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even though Urbit’s design grants political power proportionally to ownership, “[f]or the interim, full authority is held by the (Roman style) consulate.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Urbit is functionally an authoritarian regime for now. It is designed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/common-objections-to-urbit/&quot;&gt;decentralize eventually&lt;/a&gt;—Urbit documentation acknowledges a need to spread out ownership of its assets.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But, given the initial distribution of galaxies—95 galaxies to the Tlön Corporation; 50 to urbit.org (the future community foundation); 40 to Tlön employees and their family members (24 to Yarvin, who started in 2002, and 16 to everyone else who started in 2014); 34 to outside investors in Tlön; and 37 galaxies to 33 other individuals, who donated to the project, contributed code or services, won a contest, or were just in the right place at the right time—it isn’t clear what kind of further distribution of ownership they have in mind, or even whether it will be meaningful. More troubling still is that in their own words, Urbit describes this distribution as being spread “across a diverse set of entities,”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; when it seems to only encompass people in their immediate networks. This arrangement is reminiscent of Manhattan real estate: the earlier you got in, the more ownership, and thus power, you accrued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “decentralization” when used to describe governance is notoriously slippery, especially in blockchain and blockchain-adjacent contexts such as P2P. What does it mean for a government to be meaningfully decentralized? If galaxies and stars become prohibitively expensive to the point where only the wealthy can purchase them, does that lead to a decentralized government? Decentralization also says nothing about representative ratios. In the US, we have 535 members of Congress representing 3.2 million Americans; if Urbit achieves full adoption, there’ would be 256 galactic senate members representing 4.3 billion planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing to suggest that Urbit even cares about how representative its governance structures are. The word “democratic” is scarce across descriptions of Urbit’s governance. “Democracy” only appears once throughout all of urbit.org, and it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/&quot;&gt;in a sarcastic quote&lt;/a&gt;. The term also appears in an older document, and its use is telling: “Urbit will never be a democracy, but it should always remain a republic.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In that same document, Yarvin does mention that the dukes (now “galaxies” in the new terminology) will be organized democratically, but this is consistent with the republic formulation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, combined with Yarvin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/04/formalist-manifesto-originally-posted/&quot;&gt;admiration of the Roman Principate&lt;/a&gt; as an example of a government that “retain[s] the symbolic structures of democracy”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while being autocratic in practice (the Roman Principate was ruled by an emperor but maintained a superficial senate for the appearance of a continuing republic), gives me reason to doubt the intentions around governance here. A new internet under this regime could easily turn out to be just as bad as or worse than it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-urbit-supports&quot;&gt;Who Urbit Supports&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Yarvin is officially removed from the further design and development of Urbit, he still maintains a minority share in Tlön and a few thousand stars (he is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://urbit.org/posts/essays/a-founders-farewell/&quot;&gt;probably the only individual with a fair amount of Urbit address space&lt;/a&gt;”). His departure at this point is not enough to counteract his heavy, and at times exclusive, involvement in Urbit’s foundational design and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, there is an issue that goes beyond Urbit’s design and future ambitions. It comes down to the fact that if I were to support Urbit, I would also be supporting Yarvin—he still has a substantial stake in its success and, like any network-based platform, the value of Urbit increases the more people use it. At least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4bxf6f/im_curtis_yarvin_developer_of_urbit_ama/&quot;&gt;some people do support Urbit because they support Yarvin’s politics&lt;/a&gt;. Yarvin’s years writing as Mencius Moldbug were possible &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2blowhards.com/archives/2007/04/_trial_version.html&quot;&gt;because of money made during the dot-com boom&lt;/a&gt;. After announcing his departure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/ag2s4f/curtis_yarvin_quit_tlon_the_startup_making_urbit/&quot;&gt;people have expressed excitement around his return to writing&lt;/a&gt;, so we may see further works of political philosophy from him. Even if Yarvin were to never write again, the success of Urbit is likely to draw attention to its creator—and introduce more people to his past writings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond introducing Yarvin’s writings to new audiences, we should also consider how supporting Urbit supports Yarvin more directly. We can get a rough sense of Yarvin’s financial stake in Urbit, leaving aside speculation about his financial stake in Tlön itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 256 galaxies and 65,536 stars across all of Urbit.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There are roughly 4.3 billion planets that were initially evenly distributed across stars, so each star started with 65,000 planets.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the long-run Urbit developers believe $10 to be a fair price for a planet.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:23&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:23&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Assuming that the price eventually converges to $10 per planet and Urbit achieves widespread adoption, then each star is worth $650k in planet real estate alone. Planets are also expected to pay a monthly fee to their stars for routing services (which is the bare minimum service; the star may choose to offer services as well).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:24&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:24&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This fee is estimated to be anywhere from $10–$100 per month.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume the lower end, that $10/month is required for the routing services. If a star sells all of its planets and they remain under that star, that’s potentially another $650k in revenue per month. When we consider that Yarvin owns “a few percent of all stars” (which is thousands of stars)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, if Urbit does achieve widespread adoption, then that is a staggering amount of wealth. Yarvin’s nominal departure from Urbit does not change the fact that he stands to gain tremendously from its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does an internet in which Urbit achieves widespread adoption look like? I’m not sure it would look much different. You would have a personal server, sure; but then there would then be a new infrastructural layer between you and your ISP (who you’ll still have to pay) owned by &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; class of rentiers who you’ll also pay. One of the great appeals of P2P is that routing occurs almost as a side-effect of everyone using the internet, so by being online, you help others be online at essentially no additional cost. Urbit abandons this P2P property of mutual aid such that the property and power relations of the internet are mostly kept intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not certain—or even likely—that Urbit will ever achieve this level of adoption and value. What is clear, however, is that if I were to support Urbit, then I would, even in a small way, be making its spread and adoption all the more likely. We already spend so much of our time and money supporting regimes of violence, oppression, and inequality by merely existing in a capitalist society. These relationships are hard to break because they are so deeply established and entrenched within culture and the market. Urbit is not yet entrenched in the same way, and I do not want to help it get there. I want to have no part in supporting Yarvin or any other project or creator whose underlying ideology is hateful, reactionary, or anti-democratic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-words&quot;&gt;Closing Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit is still in such a nascent state with much left ambiguous. Its value (or your expectations of its value) largely depends on how much you trust the people behind it. It’s hard for me to trust people who have no problem working for someone like Yarvin who has actively contributed to the re-emergence of white supremacy and anti-democratic ideas, or who would go so far to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14671978/alt-right-mencius-moldbug-urbit-curtis-yarvin-tlon&quot;&gt;dismiss Yarvin’s Nazi apologia (“What’s so bad about Nazis?”) as “trolling.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/0066/borges.pdf&quot;&gt;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&lt;/a&gt;,” the Borges story where Yarvin’s company gets its name, describes a secret society, &lt;em&gt;Orbis Tertius&lt;/em&gt;, that architects an entirely new world, &lt;em&gt;Tlön&lt;/em&gt;, by publishing an encyclopedia describing it. Over time, bits of this fictional world begin to emerge in the real world, consuming it, such that “[t]he world will be Tlön.” What ideas are Yarvin’s Tlön trying to manifest in our world? What world would Yarvin seek to manifest with his new wealth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In asking these questions, we should consider them not only as tools for evaluating similar projects but also as criteria with we might develop new projects. What ideas do we want to manifest in our world? I absolutely agree that what Urbit positions itself against—an internet dominated by concentrated corporate interests and surveillance infrastructure—is something that internet technologists need to build alternatives to. But we shouldn’t replace it with another system of undemocratic control or one that supports far-right intellectuals. I hope to see more P2P projects that commit to most promising values of P2P systems—plurality, democracy, mutual interdependence, sharing, and cooperation—as they take on the difficult but necessary task of creating egalitarian platforms and infrastructure, rather than rehashing the old hierarchies. P2P computing is still a burgeoning technology, and while there are projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/&quot;&gt;Scuttlebutt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://beakerbrowser.com/&quot;&gt;Beaker Browser&lt;/a&gt;, and the various &lt;a href=&quot;https://fediverse.party/&quot;&gt;Fediverse projects&lt;/a&gt;, which all reflect its potential, there is plenty of room for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to collaborate with BUFU (By Us For Us). The WYFY (With You For You) School Board of the Wise is a free, online and IRL school for a distributed learning community. We hope to explore new models for collective learning for code, code of ethics and code of conduct, please follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bufubyusforus.com/thewyfyschool&quot;&gt;BUFU’s site&lt;/a&gt; for the updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUFU is a unique collective of artists, designers, storytellers and organizers. I first learned about BUFU around 2016 and I’ve been following their work closely. BUFU is building cultural solidarity among QTPOC and the wider public, combining art, fashion and music, and recently through technology. BUFU’s events feel different from any other arts and technology events. There’s an electric sense of excitement and radical inclusivity. BUFU’s conceptual approach is fearless and provocative. They explore the intersections of ideas and identifications with grace. Their aesthetic practice is rich and enticing, often combining graphic elements with photo, video and online storytelling. I’m thrilled to collaborate with them and their large community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hosted the inaugural “Orientation &amp;amp; Co-creation” at the Data and Society Research Institute (D&amp;amp;S) on May 1, 2019.The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3azPormLc0&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; is available but forgive us about the poor sound quality. The event was a culmination of long term collaboration with the D&amp;amp;S team. I intended to invite BUFU community to the D&amp;amp;S’s space and encourage them to learn about the D&amp;amp;S’s research on topics such as algorithmic accountability and AI, privacy and security, truth in the age of misinformation. I also wanted my friends at the D&amp;amp;S to experience BUFU’s organizing style and meet their community. The Distributed Web of Care project grew out of my fellowship at the D&amp;amp;S between 2017 - 2018 and it has been an intellectual home for me. The researchers and fellows at the D&amp;amp;S are creating powerful conceptual tools to gain critical perspectives about technology. I hope artists, organizers and creative individuals can utilize &lt;a href=&quot;https://datasociety.net/output/&quot;&gt;their research&lt;/a&gt;, activate it in their practice and to empower their community. A number of D&amp;amp;S researchers and staff participated in the orientation event and contributed to imagining ‘dream schools’.

&lt;p&gt;This lecture-performance by Taeyoon Choi imagines a more equitable, caring Internet and asks: what kind of network do we want for the future? Choi engages in a conversation with Chancey Fleet, Jonathan Dahan, and stewards and students from the School for Poetic Computation to explore the poetics and politics of computation, the relationship between Internet privacy and collective agency, and alternative methods of communicating via peer-to-peer protocols. The discussion considers the Internet’s underlying structure and how bodily experiences of the Internet differ for disability communities and other marginalized groups. The conversation is followed by an interactive performance choreographed by Choi and Jerron Herman, accompanied by live audio from Tiri Kananuruk and stud1nt. The movements explore how it feels to be a node programmed in centralized, decentralized, and distributed networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASL interpretation and audio description are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed Web of Care (DWC) is a collaboration between artists, writers and engineers to imagine a more equitable, caring internet for the future. The project is initiated by Taeyoon Choi, who has been working with disability community and artists to criticially challenge the notions of accessibility and inclusion. Read his article &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewinquiry.com/artificial-advancements/&quot;&gt;Artificial Advancement&lt;/a&gt; and Shannon Finnegan’s article &lt;a href=&quot;http://distributedweb.care/posts/accessibility-dreams/&quot;&gt;Accessibility Dreams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February - March 2019, we are looking for stewards who identify as a Deaf or disabled person. We are planning a large scale participatory performance art in the end of March. The event will have ASL interpretation and audio description. We would like to work with stewards who identify as a Deaf or Disabled person to create an inclusive and welcoming experience for the disability community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From February to March 2019, we are planning a large scale participatory performance art in the end of March. The event will be wheelchair accessible, and will have ASL interpretation and audio description. We would like to work with stewards who identify as a Deaf or disabled person to create an inclusive and welcoming experience for the disability community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewards are guest collaborators who contribute to DWC initiatives with their domain expertise. Stewards are invited to rehearsals for DWC events and contribute to building the piece as well as code of conduct. In this volunteer role, stewards will collaborate with fellow artists, engineers, organizers, staff and with Taeyoon Choi directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DWC is a movement activity which involves strings and other props, sound and visuals, which requires assistance of stewards to help other participants in the movement activity stay safe. We are asking for stewards to join a rehearsal and the final performance to help the choreographer and other stewards make space for people who identify as disabled to feel welcome, secure and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our efforts to imagine the future of the internet, we hope to create an inclusive and equitable experience for everyone, however, we understand the impossibility of this as there may be conflict of access needs. In order to be prepared for all contingencies, we are inviting the disability community to be a part of planning and execution of the project. We also hope to avoid creating an unintentionally exclusive experience, therefore stewards mentorship and guidance will help us create a better experience for everyone attending the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rehearsal dates are March 3, 2-5 PM and March 25, 2-5 PM, 2019 in wheelchair accesible locations in Manhattan, NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is a condensed transcription of a conversational talk given by the author for the Distributed Web of Care workshop series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My studio experience as a designer focused on interactive installations. While user experience usually connotes people’s movements through an online interface, the phrase could also apply to engagement with physical installations. There are cues that help people navigate a physical environment with a digital layer. This weaving in and out of physical and digital space — which  all could be considered an interface — is a space that should motivate discursion rather than display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense of navigation informs how I construct online archives, which I consider a type of activation of a physical site and collection of objects. I would call myself an archival enthusiast, but I’m not a trained archivist, and I would never use the term because it disregards the years of required training. When I first moved to San Francisco, as in all new cities, I sought out used bookstores. Then I fell into a rich library/archival community. While indexes, taxonomy, and categorization have always fascinated me, I was dissatisfied with the use of pre-existing platforms and their navigational structures. Digitized books, regardless of their form or content, were seemingly dumped into templates that used skeuomorphic design (like page turns) and poor UX (like clicking through hundreds of pages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/mindy/01_mindy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image description: L: Jedi Archives, Star Wars: Episode 2, Attack of the Clones // R: Trinity College Library, Dublin”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the Jedi archives from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Episode 2, Attack of the Clones.&lt;/em&gt; It looks like a real library, except these book spines have transmissive light. I see this as a metaphor for how people think about digital or online libraries, transplanting shelves onto the screen with a search field, and not necessarily considering how digital space is different. The original library is based off Trinity College Library in Dublin. Physical libraries have a constraint of nesting books next to each other on shelves. And despite this, libraries have an embedded serendipitous discovery. It’s really easy to get lost in a library. There’s nooks, aisles, hidden corners, shelves nested on top of each other. And that depth, even if it’s linear online, is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prelinger Library and Archives in San Francisco offers a fascinating example of a physical space that creates its own unique taxonomy as a reflection of their collected objects. Founded by Megan and Rick Prelinger, the library includes obscure printed ephemera for which Megan created a novel indexing system based on geospatial location. At the front of the aisles you have all the books related to San Francisco, based on theme. The further back you move into the library, you travel through different regions and finally land in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the archive exists in physical space, Rick Prelinger offers encouraging insight the digitization of collections. In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JDDanuvz1fJXxhHzD64ymQQ20eMsOWHj/view&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appropriation Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he writes, “If cultural permaculture is our goal, we might think of finding thoughtful ways to represent and re-contextualize old works. So how can we think of alternative methods for digitizing analog materials into a digital interface or a digital screen.” I embraced this as a move away from templatization online and towards the creation of bespoke interfaces that allow for specific viewing conditions for different types of content, much like the geospatial index adopted in his own collection. Rick also states that “mortar is just as historical as bricks, but we only ever talk about the bricks.” Mortar to bricks. We, lay people, can break these histories apart, add or note what is missing, and then rearrange or reform these bricks for our current climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Image description: 110 West 40th Street, New York, present day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the &lt;em&gt;Avant Garde&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fact&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Eros&lt;/em&gt; archival microsites with Jon Gacnik, co-founder of Folder Studio, and Alexander Tochilovsky, curator of the Herb Lubalin Study Center at the Cooper Union. (Note: in the original talk, I explained our decisions for the site interface, redacted here). These publications, created by Ralph Ginzburg and Herb Lubalin in the 1960s-70s, were considered controversial at the time, and led to prison time over a battle with the US Government over obscenity charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first launched these sites, I was happy that Laurel [Schwulst] noted the domain name 110west40th.com. Sasha [Alexander Tochilovsky] and I had carefully considered other domain names. It didn’t seem right to name it after one of the co-creators. They have a larger body of work, first of all, and these publications are the result of a collaboration in a physical space. We decided to embed this in the naming structure to ground the online sites in the physical site, their studio in Manhattan on 110 West 40th. When Laurel mentioned it, she included a screenshot of Google Maps of the location which has become a shop called Crisp. The domain was able to narrate a bit of the story about where these three iconic publications were born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Image description: “Mosaic of Subcultures,” image excerpt from A Pattern Language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter “A Mosaic of Subcultures” in &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vDHRtYnKYzchQtMTZOPQfXOQrepc8LB_/view&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pattern Language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, notes the importance of subcultures, which I find helpful to revisit when designing bespoke interfaces and considering online communities. Instead of homogenizing, or templatizing, visible differences in different communities should be embraced. Moving from one space to another should feel unique, representative of the various cultures, people, identities included. These spaces, however, should be small and nested closely together so you can naturally stumble out of one and into another. You can feel aesthetic or tonal shifts; they are not walled gardens. They are open for others who may not be part of the subculture to visit, embracing inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter motivated a workshop that I created for &lt;a href=&quot;https://a-b-z.co/&quot;&gt;A-B-Z-TXT&lt;/a&gt; 2017. This computational typography summer school is based in Toronto, created by Michèle Champagne, Garry Ing, and Greg Smith. We named it ASCII Town, or A-B-Z-TWN. After a brief introduction to ASCII art, typewriter art, and concrete poetry, the two hour drawing exercise asked how we might still draw with these gridded, constrained systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/mindy/06_mindy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image description: ASCII Town text file, example by Owen Dodd, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a humble text editor, participants drew the exterior of their ‘home’ and a room that others could visit after clicking through. Jon [Gacnik] created a script that would aggregate the exteriors on a group landing page and create detail pages of the interiors using simple labels, ‘Outside:’ and ‘Inside:’ in the text file. The only constraint were these labels and the inclusion of their name somewhere on the exterior. Participants could publish by dragging the file into a communal FTP. ASCII Town asks the user to consider alternative interfaces for online communities, and how this change in interaction might affect how we choose to engage with others in digital spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Image description: Kameelah Rasheed, “On Refusal,” 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/kameelah-janan-rasheed-on-research-and-archiving/&quot;&gt;The Creative Independent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Kameelah Rasheed states that archiving our histories is a way to actively engage with the way we move through the world. This recenters us, so we think of ourselves as constructed subjects that come from a long lineage of histories that we can reflect back into our personal archives. I think this idea is crucial, particularly when we consider archiving digital space, and the histories of our own constructions online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently a summer fellow at the Internet Archive, co-organizing the Arts Track of the Decentralized Web Summit with Sam Hart. The goal of the Summit at large is to bring together technologists, humanitarians, policy-makers, designers, and artists to discuss the constraints and affordances of various forms of decentralization. For example, with the Dat protocol and Beaker browser, it’s really easy to create and clone a static site or dataset. This feature suggests an invitation to archiving the web, which is noticeably different from ‘scraping’ a site, which is possible but traditionally unauthorized. The Dat and Beaker browser foregrounds cloning and archiving as an essential feature of a decentralized network. Your peers can seed and help host the site. Paul Frazee, a co-founder of Beaker, aptly stated, “Your friends are your data center.” We decide what is valuable, what we want to support, and question what we should read or publish online. While I’m excited about the possibilities, I’m cautious about a technocratic misconception that implementing a decentralized technical or architectural infrastructure will lead to ethical governance or the thoughtful development of culture. How can we reshape online culture as a whole? It’s not like creating a decentralized Facebook will actually make us more connected, even if we do have ownership of our data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arts Track has a conversation series, installations, workshops, and performances that will try to create accessible points of entry, historicize the movement, and consider novel uses of the decentralized web. It’s nice to see some of those people here too. Laurel Schwulst is co-leading a workshop called p2p2p2p. Melanie Hoff, Callil Capuozzo, and a larger team are creating an interactive installation called Distributed Gardens. Yeli Omayeli Arenyeka is co-leading a workshop that prototypes the DWeb with browser extensions. And Taeyoon Choi, with help from Lai Yi Ohlsen, will kick-off the Summit with a large-scale string network performance of Distributed Web of Care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;qa-audio-transcript-shortened-for-coherence&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A, Audio transcript shortened for coherence.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: Do you experience tension with making something with a single version or duplication that is reproducible endlessly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A [Mindy]: Attribution immediately comes to mind. I think it’s fine to duplicate something endlessly if the source material is noted. In some ways, this is what’s great about an open source model. The problem is the difficulty of a precedent that does not include this. I believe it is very important to include this, a clear source or an initial link that is archived to prevent link rot. p2p protocols like dat or platforms like Github allows for this, because you’re cloning something that already exists and a is trail built. Duplication is also important for preservation purposes also. Even at the Internet Archive, where I’m currently a fellow, they have crawlers that click every link and archive every page. They are able to archive the internet once every four months, roughly. It’s only through screenshots, so dynamic content is really hard to capture. But while they have a copy of everything on their servers in the Bay, they have a duplicate in Alexandria and another in an undisclosed location, understandably. The fire at the Library of Alexandria destroyed all of the content it held, and the founder of Internet Archive, Brewster Kahle, will state that this was a key reference for their priority to duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: When you were talking about your Avant Garde work, you mentioned that you wished the rest of the internet could be more like this. Were you trying to emphasis on idiosyncratic archives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A [Mindy]: By that statement, I meant I would like things to be comprehensive. When people go to an article, do they actually read the whole text? The way it’s laid out now, in these long scrolls with embedded links, with link rot, most don’t read the entirety. In the essay “How We Read: Close, Hyper, Machine,” N. Katherine Hayles writes about how we scan the first few sentences and then your eyes go down. It could be attributed to short term attention span, but I think we can give people more credit than that. It’s built into the reading structure. So by comprehensive, I meant, yes, make the information more robust, but also, what are ways we can explore different ways that encourage comprehension on the screen. I don’t know if Avant Garde is the best way to do that. But I felt that for this publication, we were trying to be very thoughtful about the interface, so people can keep digging. I’d hope that we can be more thoughtful about digestion and comprehension, instead of speed, whatever form that takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: Could talk about the difference between the library and the archive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A [Mindy]: Can I throw that to you, Zach [Zach Coble, head of the Digital Scholarship Services at the NYU Libraries]?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A [Zach]: I’m a librarian, and I see libraries as being primarily driven by access. If you want a book or an article or a piece of data, libraries will help you get access to them. Whereas archives are driven by preservation. For that book in the archive that you want to read, every time it’s pulled that off the shelf, the archivist is thinking if there’s some damage that’s happened to the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A [Mindy]: I was going to say something similar. I was thinking about inclusivity versus exclusivity. Public libraries are amazing because they’re becoming these new cultural centers, as well as continuing to be a silent space. It is about access. It’s easier to enter a public library rather than an archive — no appointments or white gloves. I feel like there’s a tension between who an archive is for and who created it. It claims to be for community memory, but if it’s inaccessible, it becomes an ethical question about whose memory we are preserving, what we consider valuable, who has the credentials to access it, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A [Taeyoon]: One thing about libraries and archives and their distinction: archives tend to centralize knowledge and power to the institution. Libraries tend to open up and distribute that knowledge and power. While libraries have selection policies, archives tend to be have even more narrow and strict policies about what comes in to the archive. The power of collection leads to preservation, and prioritizing of certain information to last a long time. Take for example, in Los Angeles, The Getty Archive is a very powerful collection of articles and cultural items. It’s a vast resource but it’s not accessible. You need to be a scholar or an authorized person to access the archive. On the other side of town, there’s also a group called Los Angeles Contemporary Archive (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lacarchive.com/&quot;&gt;LACA&lt;/a&gt;), which is an artist-run non-profit organization. LACA takes on a more subversive and grassroots approach to the archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A [Mindy]: When I mentioned Irit Rogoff and inherited knowledge, that’s exactly what I meant, The same stories are being told over and over, so certain narratives develop cultural capital. That affects what is preserved and what is fixed in history books. Her “response to conditions,” then, is trying to push against these taught histories and how these smaller histories can be told. A strategy for that is, like Taeyoon mentioned, citizen archives and grassroots spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: Earlier, you were talking about the difference between digital and physical archives and getting lost in physical spaces. In your work, have you thought about how developers and designers can help users have a serendipitous experience like that online?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A [Mindy]: If you can make your own website, even if it’s ugly and messy, maybe we can reframe it as ugly beautiful. It does give you a lot of power when you see something that you’ve made living in the world. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Does it really matter if something is responsive or snapped to a grid? Maybe that works well for some things but not necessarily for personal voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The qualities of any action or tool that aims to create accessibility communicates the creator’s assumptions about disabled people — not only in terms of its logistics, but also in terms of its personality, tone, and style. Accessibility measures continually fail to treat disabled people as complete human beings, prioritizing a checklist of ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990) compliance over the interests, nuances, desires, and comfort of those using the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare the examples in tweets hashtagged &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rampfail&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;#RampFail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rampjoy&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;#RampJoy&lt;/a&gt;. #RampFail has lots of examples of uninspired access — scenarios where someone has gestured toward accessibility, but missed the mark. #RampJoy shows how access can become a source of delight and a part of disability culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/shannon/02_Shannon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image description: A temporary metal ramp is set on a set of four steps. The ramp doesn’t look safe or integrated into the space. The associated tweet by @wheelchairdancr reads, “today’s #rampfail is an unsecured, temporary metal #ramp propped up on stone stairs #accessible #architecture”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/shannon/03_Shannon.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image description: 4 dancers in wheelchairs face each other holding onto a metal railing with 50 feet of ramp going uphill and downhill on either side of them. A camera person shoots footage nearby. The associated tweet by @wheelchairdancr reads, “With all the #rampfail out in the world. Here is a clear example of #rampjoy. Almost 100 ft of sloped ramp, w/ 2 lanes to go up side by side w/friends, and flats to rest every 30 ft. Also, location of the recent dance film project I choreographed in #Edmonton at #UAlberta”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at the “accessible” route to the Ace Hotel New York’s boardroom, where the Distributed Web of Care skillshares took place. This route is a prime example of uninspired, compliance-oriented access. This route was clearly designed by an architect to meet code and then never considered again. The route reveals not only the vast limitations of the ADA, but also reflects the architect and building owner’s lack of attention to disabled visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/shannon//04_Shannon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image description: A simple, hand-drawn diagram showing my memory of the route from the boardroom to the lobby. Features include: loooooong hallway, multiple unmarked doors, a kitchen area, and the back area of a cafe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am extremely grateful for the protections of the ADA, it should never be considered a template for accessibility, as is obvious from the “accessible” route to the boardroom. The route is very indirect — a classic problem with “accessible” routes. This may work okay for some wheelchair users, but presents problems for lots of other people. Imagine someone using a walker. Likely, the the stairs aren’t an option for them but neither is walking a long distance to get to the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to it’s logistical failures, the route conveys volumes about the business owner’s understanding of their disabled visitors. The route has no signage and goes through many back-of-house areas. There is nothing about the route that communicates that the hotel thought an actual human would travel it, much less a human they want to delight and welcome to their hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/shannon//4.5_Shannon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image description: Distributed Web of Care Skillshare participants being lead through the Ace Hotel’s accessible route.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access is complex. I went to a talk in 2017 by scholar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.similinton.com/&quot;&gt;Simi Linton&lt;/a&gt; where she said access is often “expensive and disruptive.” We are all operating with limited money, time, and capacity to organize, but I am disappointed by how often people and institutions miss opportunities to do better, even if in small ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing much needed wayfinding, a fun sign along the “accessible” route would go a long way toward communicating “We see you, we expected you, we understand not only are you someone who needs an elevator, but you also enjoy fun and interesting things.” A sign is far from a complete solution, but it’s a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my art practice, I think about how we can move towards better and more nuanced approaches to access. Instead of focusing on compliance and doing the minimum, what if we approach access creatively and generously, centering disability culture? How do we make spaces and experiences that disabled people not only &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; access, but &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to access?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/shannon//05_Shannon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image description: An orange wall with big text in a stair-inspired font that says, “Anti-Stairs Club Lounge.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I created an installation for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wassaicproject.org/&quot;&gt;Wassaic Project&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Anti-Stairs Club Lounge&lt;/em&gt;. The Wassaic Project’s exhibition space Maxon Mills is inaccessible: seven flights of stairs, with no ramp or elevator access above the ground floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Stairs Club Lounge&lt;/em&gt; is a space exclusively for visitors who cannot or choose not to go upstairs. You get the passcode to enter the lounge by signing a form at the front desk certifying you are not going upstairs in the mill. Inside the lounge, there is seating, reading materials, chilled seltzer, candy, artwork, and a charging station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/shannon//06_Shannon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image description: The interior of the lounge featuring chairs, reading materials, lamps, candy, and a mini-fridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the lounge as a way to highlight the inaccessibility of the exhibition space while also adding to disabled visitor’s experience of the exhibition space. I designed the lounge with lots of fun details — custom cushions printed with the Anti-Stairs Club Lounge logo, a stair-themed clock face I made out of sculpey, books that I have found helpful in understanding my identity as a disabled person. I painted a wall mural that reads “The higher you climb, the farther you fall” to add a humorous touch to the anti-stairs ethos of the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wassaic Project has a long way to go to becoming an accessible space. As one disabled artist, I am not interested in (nor am I necessarily trained to) help make those changes. There are accessibility consultants who have expertise in all the details of creating an accessible space. But my hope is that &lt;em&gt;Anti-Stairs Club Lounge&lt;/em&gt; pushes people to recognize that things need to change and that change can come in many forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/shannon//07_Shannon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image description: On the left side, a screenshot of an Instagram post by @museummammy. The photo is describe in the caption as “two authors who just saw a layout of their first book. the woman in the foreground wears glasses and the woman in the background wears pink sunglasses and is holding up a peace sign. both women are radiating with pride and hope for the future. On the other side, a screenshot of an Instagram post by @mzalopany. The photo is describe in the caption as “a screen shot of me being very impressed by my nephew Harry’s new hat. The hat is a plastic green roof taken from a doll’s house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital and physical access have interesting parallels. I am currently a resident at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eyebeam.org/&quot;&gt;Eyebeam&lt;/a&gt; where I’ve been thinking about creative ways to write and present &lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/&quot;&gt;alt-text&lt;/a&gt; (image descriptions for blind and low vision people who use screen readers). I want to move alt-text from the realm of compliance to a space of exploration and experimentation. Alt-text has the potential to be a form of poetry, a process where people put care into the way they use language. This project is a starting point for imagining an internet that prioritizes disabled people’s interests, desires, inclusion, and delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hopeful that the ways we approach access as a society will continue to expand and evolve. We need to focus on centering disability culture and acknowledging the complexity and nuance of disabled people. I know this will not happen without the presence of disabled people as designers, artists, thinkers, leaders, and creators. As disability activist and designer &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativemornings.com/talks/liz-jackson&quot;&gt;Liz Jackson&lt;/a&gt; says, “Whatever you do, don’t commit to disability—commit to disabled people.” So look around at the spaces that you occupy (both physical and digital) and observe who’s there and who’s not. Where are there indirect routes, obstacles, misleading signs, and barriers that keep people out of those spaces?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;When have you noticed steps being taken toward access in your life? This could be at your job, at events you attend, as you move through the city, in your social circles, etc. Do you have any thoughts about the quality or characteristics of that access?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are some ways we can advocate for access?&lt;/li&gt;

Her current motto is “Reinventing my strangeness as an art form that only I am the perfect practitioner of.” She’s created Anti-Stairs Club Lounge, Disability History PSA, and other projects about disability culture and access.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">by Shannon Finnegan, DWC Artist in Residence</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Creative Self Publishing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/creative-publishing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Creative Self Publishing" /><published>2019-01-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/creative-publishing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/creative-publishing/">&lt;p&gt;by Cleo Miao, DWC Design Fellow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an artist working with video, sound, sculpture, and performance. I’m from China and I’m currently based in Boston. A lot of my art plays with the poetics and absurdities of digital tools and culture and tries to make sense of identities and bodies in virtual spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time making silly websites. I see it as a way for me to draw or sketch without having a sketchbook, or without really wanting to draw. One &lt;a href=&quot;http://cleomiao.info/plath/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a website is one that generates fake Sylvia Plath poetry through natural language processing. I make many websites like this. Every year I get a bill of hundreds of dollars for trying to keep the domains for the next year, and I usually say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of my fascination with technology started because of the urge to bypass internet censorship in China where I grew up. We were a bunch of high school kids trying to see art, music, and fashion that was outside of the great firewall. The technology offered us the possibility to imagine a new freedom to learn, create and publish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside a country where you can’t really speak your mind freely, publishing is something that’s completely controlled. Growing up always having to think about what I write, and especially what I put online, I grew to really value the freedom to publish, to share ideas and information. Even for a place like here where everyone has more freedom to express themselves, the content we consume is still more curated by platforms and determined by machine learning. What is lacking is the freedom to accept strangeness and be able to discover content independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking more and more about creative publishing. I found this quote from the book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/LudovicoAlessandroPostDigitalPrint.TheMutationOfPublishingSince1894&quot;&gt;Post Digital Print&lt;/a&gt;” by Alessandro Ludovico, which I thought was something really important to think about. He was talking about Avant Garde and independent publishing: “The main concern here is neither commercial success nor the aesthetic purity of the printed experiment, nor even the archiving of works. Rather this kind of publishing is all about fostering and spreading ideas among like-minded people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here he’s talking about print media, but the same idea can be expanded to other forms of DIY publishing, such as pirate radios, self-released CD’s and cassettes and many more. For me, one of the biggest attractions of DIY publishing is the possibility to build very intimate communities and establish communication channels with more personal accountability. It is amazing to see people coming together from different backgrounds to collaborate on something creative and often times rebellious against established power structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediarins.xyz&quot;&gt;collective&lt;/a&gt; in Boston with people doing digital, electronic, and experimental music and art. The whole collective is very much based around the DIY ethos. Existing in a community of people making and publishing from their living rooms and bedrooms with computers and tape machines, we took a very similar approach. But we didn’t really want to release our music on cassettes since we’re very drawn to the digital hi-fi, and we didn’t want the albums to only have music. We ended up making these flash drive releases that camouflage as cassettes, and on the flash drives are songs, digital paintings, snippets of codes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/fellows/cleo3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges of publishing through platforms is that it becomes something that limits the formats for creative publishing. The platforms are taking care of every aspect of creative publishing which ends up leaving the content creators very little freedom when they want to go beyond the formats supported by the platforms. When we released the albums on the internet through platforms such as Bandcamp and Soundcloud, we’re no longer able to publish everything that was included in the flash drives and the albums had to be reduced to only stereo music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newer digital technologies such as the distributed web, create room for a new DIY that carries on the philosophy of the old DIY and translates not only the content but the infrastructure of the old DIY, so it can exist online. This new DIY should, like the old DIY, depend on a collective action instead of centralizing platforms and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I ever made on the distributed web was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dat://a57302f3cb4dc9bf8176e08e0470fd3ba805e0a57d11c5a792f8df237fa44e90/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that tracks all active users’ cursor information. This was a very liberating experience because I didn’t have to go through all the hoops of getting a URL and trying to find somewhere to host it because it was hosted straight from my computer. And it was a very fun experience of being able to see actual connections that I’m making with other people that are also online at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/fellows/cursors.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freedom to publish and remix is something that’s very important for creative people today. Sampling collages and found footages are such a big part of what a lot of people are creating, and also in terms of making zines. The history of making zines is copying from a lot of other things because you have a scanner, a printer, and access to information. You want to curate and remix that information and make it your own. However, attribution and history are very important in this aspect of remixing. This is a quote from Aria Dean’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://reallifemag.com/poor-meme-rich-meme/&quot;&gt;Poor Meme Rich Meme&lt;/a&gt;,” which was mentioned in one of the skillshares. “When we say that the internet extends and exacerbates the same old offline relations, we mean it. In keeping with historical precedent, the cultural and affective labor of black individuals online largely goes unrecognized and un(der)compensated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another aspect of the distributed web that I think is very interesting. The history of content creation is being kept and being acknowledged. When you create content on the distributed web you acknowledge that other people can remix it, and when you remix other people’s content by forking their websites, you acknowledge the authorship of that content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created activities for every one of the skillshares. The first one was an analog experience of the distributed web, where we created poetry collectively. And in the last one, we created a digital zine that’s based on the distributed web, where everyone created one page of it, and we made it into a letter to the artist. All of the pages are forked from this main page of the zine, and everyone still has authorship to all the pages, so if they ever want to change anything, any of the content, or if they ever want to delete pages, there’s still the control to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/fellows/cleo4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this fascination with digital formats and the physical distribution of digital formats, I made a simple tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://dat://b15e9f30ce83cb0fbc437b980a343e75701f02dd15531542f8d1f850657465e1/&quot;&gt;Dat QR&lt;/a&gt;, which is a QR code reader and generator for Dat URLs. It de-obscure the very long strings of letters and numbers for Dat addresses. Being able to print out the codes and give something physical to someone else becomes another part of the process of sharing and creating communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cleomiao.info/&quot;&gt;cleo (yuekai) miao&lt;/a&gt; is a Chinese artist currently based in boston, MA. She is an anti-disciplinary media artist and works to make sense of identities and bodies in virtual spaces. She plays with both the poetics and the absurdity of digital tools and culture, and considers the reality that is configured and mediated by images. Through playful investigation, cleo questions and spectates the role and affect of photographic images and mediums. Having grown up with the Chinese Internet, she is passionate about new possibilities of freedom and democracy offered by technology. However, at the same time she is wary of the systematic and algorithmic oppression and violence supported by unethical or inconsiderate technological infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">by Cleo Miao, DWC Design Fellow</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Racial Justice in the Distributed Web</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/racial-justice/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Racial Justice in the Distributed Web" /><published>2019-01-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/racial-justice</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/racial-justice/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Taeyoon Choi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider the internet as an environment, a digital space where limits are imposed upon access just as in physical environments. Reflective of the society which we inhabit, discriminatory principles are embedded in the digital space through racist, sexist, and ableist ideologies and exclusionary algorithms. Jeff Chang writes in his recent book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bealright.net/&quot;&gt;We Gon’ Be Alright: Notes on Race and Resegregation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, “Segregation is still linked to racial disparities of every kind. Where you live plays a significant role in the quality of food and the quality of education available to you, your ability to get a job, buy a home, and build wealth, the kind of health care you receive and how long you live, and whether you will have anything to pass on to the next generation.” The ability to access online spaces and information can certainly be added to this list. As a disparity unfolds in the digital space, I feel a shared responsibility to intervene in these systems of exclusion, and to build a more equitable web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now a moment and opportunity to develop a different kind of internet, an internet which is more just, diverse and caring. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/&quot;&gt;distributed web&lt;/a&gt; presents an alternative to the centralization of the big five tech companies. Similar initiatives are often referred to as the decentralized web. Although they have signficiant semantic and technical differences, I will group them as a family of likeminded projects for this essay. Harnessing new protocols like &lt;a href=&quot;https://datproject.org&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/&quot;&gt;SSB&lt;/a&gt; and various blockchain experiments, the distributed web presents a peer-to-peer model, prioritizing collective agency and individual ownership of data and code. Much like its infrastructure of autonomous nodes, the development of the distributed web is a collaborative effort, based on the community’s genuine excitement about the do-it-yourself, grassroots approach to rebuilding the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my limited exposure and engagement with the distributed web communities, the developers and contributors working on the distributed web have not been ethnically or sexually diverse. Most people I interact with in real life and on line have been white or light skinned, cis-gender or male, from or working in the first world countries. This is not anything new. The ‘internet’ as we know today have been developed by white male engineers working in academia and military-industrial complexes. It’s not surprising the protocols and networks, as well as it’s epistemologies and affects are contained in their imaginations. To be more accurate, the internet has not been developed solely by the white male engineers, but the narratives of it’s development have been dominated by the triumphs of white male engineers. To learn about the queer engineers, your can read Jacob Gaboury’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/feb/19/queer-computing-1/&quot;&gt;A Queer History of Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and to learn about the female engineers, you can read about Clare L. Evan’s book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/545427/broad-band-by-claire-l-evans/9780735211759/&quot;&gt;Broad Band&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Things are changing. For example the first &lt;a href=&quot;decentralizedweb.net&quot;&gt;Decentralized Web Summit&lt;/a&gt; organized by the Internet Archive in San Franscisco in the summer of 2018 made explicit efforts to invite people of color, artists and creatives, and those who would not be able to afford to attend an expensive conference. While the sense of unsettling innovations, threats, opportunities were present in the conference, so were the presence of human rights advocates-lawyers, activists-community organizers, artists-storytellers. A space that’s cohabitated by various species will be mutually advantagenous and more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://distributedwed.care/&quot;&gt;Distributed Web of Care&lt;/a&gt; is an art project that engages this moment of technological change through performance, drawing, critical writing and community building to address the inequalities in the internet and the power dynamics within the traditional axis of technological production. Central to this project is the question: “What kind of network do we want for the future?” In redistributing the internet’s keys (literally as unique hashes for data and metaphorically as invitations to access), and infrastructure (the fiber optic cables connecting new and obsolete electronics), there is an opportunity to redistribute power and reconfigure who can code the principles and ideologies of our technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Distributed Web of Care seeks to shift the center of tech culture from corporations to a diverse community of technologists, artists, engineers, and scholars, holding identities across races, genders, privilege, and abilities. If the “new internet” is developed by people of color, women, queer folk, and disabled people, we can imagine new protocols and networks, untethered by the constraints which have led to these voices to remain excluded. To bring equality to access and equity to ownership of technology, we need to create new narratives of the internet, tools for learning and empowerment, and systems of interdependence among communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues of race, disability, habitat and gender all intersect in the places we live and interact in, whether physical or digital, on the condition of access. Social media and web 2.0 has encouraged a gentrification of the internet, where information is segregated and digital labor commodified. Aria Dean writes in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reallifemag.com/poor-meme-rich-meme/&quot;&gt;Poor Meme, Rich Meme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; about the displacement of capital in the attention economy, in which young creators of memes, most often people of color, rarely get compensated while the tech giants profit from our engagement with these platforms. I see my practise as ‘networking,’ like weaving or knitting, where access is the fundamental building block to examine and connect the intersectionalities of race, gender, disability and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remain struck by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/bloodorange/do-you-see-my-skin-through-the-flames&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“Do you see my skin through the flames”&lt;/em&gt; by artist Blood Orange, Dev Hynes. He sings,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Tasting pain coming from a place of truth,
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
to be another in a messy world
&lt;br /&gt;
to feel like giving in another turn?
&lt;br /&gt; 
You wouldn’t listen if I told you
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
so how can I become anyone?” 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People who have been identified as an ‘another,’ marginalized people who carry ‘otherness,’ find inaccessible spaces to be hostile. They are told they can’t be anyone in that space. In order for them to feel welcome there, they need a direct invitation from the people who hold power in that space. In other words, the distributed web developers and organizations need to make active invitations to artists, creatives, policy makers, activists, organizers and those who don’t identify as developers or hold privileges to access education and technology. With a warm welcome, they can visually, sonically, empathetically redefine the distributed web. They may hold a power of queering, cripping, imagining and reverse engineering which can mend the boundaries between code and code of conduct, challenge the definitions and bring together those who saw each other as ‘another’ or the ‘Other.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example Roy Decarava, a photographer who was active during the ‘60s and onward. In an article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/a-true-picture-of-black-skin.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A True Picture of Black Skin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Teju Cole writes about Decarava’s photography and its use of the commercially available films, optimized for light skin since the majority of consumers were white people preferring to look tan. This bias embedded in the technology of film led to photographs of people of color depicted with skin much darker. DeCarava uses the biased optics against itself, presenting a photograph of Mississippi Freedom Marchers in Washington D.C. in 1963, where the determination in her face is captured by the high contrast dark image. Rather than manipulate the photograph to make her skin brighter, or normalizing data, DeCarava makes creative interpretations of both the subject’s presence in the photo and the exclusionary principles of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/racialjustice/DeCarava.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Image Description: Black and white photograph of a young black woman wearing uniform, standing among other black people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the consumer film of the ‘60s, contemporary code condition the reality to appear with biases. Our perceptions are altered by the information we have access to, and our decisions are never independent from the consciousness altering technologies. When a facial detection algorithm categorizes dark skinned person as animals, how is that different from films that render dark skinned person invisible? The most urgent task for anyone concerned with racial justice now is to acknowledge &lt;em&gt;we are not living in a post-racial environment.&lt;/em&gt; The goal of the Distributed Web of Care is to expand the definition of ‘code’ and ‘coder’ to a more racially diverse, inclusive and creative definition, building resources and a community invested in a more equitable internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past ten months of the project, I’ve been learning and unlearning from my collaborators: fellows, residents, stewards and students about the web we want. I’m glad to have had oppportunities to work with diverse artists and writers on the project. Many of the essays in this project are not addressing the internet directly. Instead, they explore racism, Feminism, disability theory and arts. It was my intention to &lt;em&gt;fold&lt;/em&gt; cultural criticism with technology criticism, creating a lush garden of epistemologies and a chasm for new definitions. For example, how can we define ‘peer’ from a social practice art perspective, from a community banking perspective and from a peer to peer protocol perspective? When the new distributed web becomes something tangible, it will be a network of various people who are generous with their talent and care. If the current distributed technologies (such as blockchain applications) start from a place of trustlessness, the distributed web of care will start from trustfullness. Let’s imagine a world of trustfullness and care, where protocols work on behalf of those who need the most support. Perhaps it will be an equitable web, an environment where people who associate in multiple racial identities cohabitate in a nurturing ecosystem. Racial justice is connected to all other aspects of justice in our environment. As Nabil Hassein, my co-organizer of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfpc.io/codeecologies&quot;&gt;Code Ecologies&lt;/a&gt; conference asked “How are all of our relationships?” in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deconstructconf.com/2018/nabil-hassein-computing-climate-change-and-all-our-relationships&quot;&gt;Computing Climate Change and All Our Relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Race, environment and code (language, math, logic, systems and infrastructure) are connected web of intentions, desires, hopes and needs.  I think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://poeticcomputation.info&quot;&gt;poetic computation&lt;/a&gt;, distributed web and other do-it-yourself low tech alternatives such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html&quot;&gt;Low-tech Magazine&lt;/a&gt; as small, honest attempts to create justice in the technological environment and digital space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone who’s expressed their support and interest, especially those who purchased Care T-shirts and Hoodies for fundraising and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://datasociety.org&quot;&gt;Data and Society&lt;/a&gt; for my fellowship. I plan to continue the project in 2019 with various public events in art institutions, conferences and schools. Coming up, I will lead the Accessibility, Disability and Care track at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://day.processing.org/pcd-la-tracks.html&quot;&gt;Processing Community Day&lt;/a&gt; in LA and speak at the Deaf and Disability Futures at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tangledarts.org/events/cripping-the-arts-2019/&quot;&gt;Cripping the Arts&lt;/a&gt; conference in Toronto in January. I have some more plans for events in NYC this spring along with an open call for fellows to be announced in March, 2019. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/tchoi8&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; maybe the best place to find out the latest information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we code to care and code carefully? The Distributed Web of Care (DWC) is a research initiative on communication infrastructure, exploring the Distributed Web as a peer-to-peer, alternative web which prioritizes personhood, collective agency and individual ownership of data and code. Initiated by Taeyoon Choi, artist and cofounder of the School for Poetic Computation in NYC,  in collaboration with various artists, writers, technologists and community organizers, DWC imagines distributed networks as a form of interdependence and stewardship, in critical opposition to the network platforms and infrastructures that dominate the world today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At LACA, Taeyoon Choi will focus on archiving the DWC skillshares, performances and parties, and hold a few informal gatherings of LA based practitioners over home cooked meals. Follow their process on the project website and LACA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/lacarchive/?hl=en&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
